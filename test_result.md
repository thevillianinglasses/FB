# Test Results & User Problem Statement

## Original User Problem Statement
**Issue reported**: "i cant seem to run in desktop"

### Specific Problems Identified:
1. Cannot access localhost:8000 (incorrect port - should be 8001 for backend)
2. MongoDB not installed locally 
3. Login credentials confusion (tried admin/admin_123, admin-007, admin_007 instead of admin/admin_007)
4. Missing local environment setup

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines:
- MUST test backend functionality using `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent
- Test all authentication endpoints
- Verify database connectivity
- Test role-based access control
- Validate all API endpoints for each module

### Frontend Testing Guidelines:
- MUST ask user permission before testing frontend using `auto_frontend_testing_agent`
- Test login functionality
- Test navigation between modules
- Verify role-based dashboard access
- Test patient registration and management features

### Communication Protocol:
1. Always read this file before invoking testing agents
2. Update test results immediately after testing
3. Follow the sequence: Backend → User Permission → Frontend
4. Document all issues found and fixes applied

## Current System Configuration

### Ports:
- Backend: localhost:8001 ✓
- Frontend: localhost:3000 (may conflict to 3001) ✓

### Credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin_007 ✓

### Database:
- MongoDB required at: mongodb://localhost:27017/unicare_ehr
- User Status: NOT INSTALLED ❌

## Test Results Log

### [Initial Analysis - Not Tested Yet]
**Status**: Pending local environment setup

**Issues to Address**:
1. ❌ MongoDB installation missing
2. ❌ Wrong port access (user trying 8000 instead of 8001)
3. ❌ Login credential confusion
4. ❌ Local environment setup incomplete

**Next Steps**:
1. Help user install MongoDB
2. Clarify correct ports and credentials
3. Provide step-by-step local setup guide
4. Test backend connectivity after setup
5. Test frontend functionality (with user permission)

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User is trying to run application locally on desktop
- Needs complete local environment setup guide
- Requires MongoDB installation and configuration
- Needs clarification on correct URLs and credentials
