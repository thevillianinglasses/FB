# Test Results & User Problem Statement

## Original User Problem Statement
**Issue reported**: "i cant seem to run in desktop"

### Specific Problems Identified:
1. Cannot access localhost:8000 (incorrect port - should be 8001 for backend)
2. MongoDB not installed locally 
3. Login credentials confusion (tried admin/admin_123, admin-007, admin_007 instead of admin/admin_007)
4. Missing local environment setup

## Current System Status - CRITICAL BUGS IDENTIFIED ⚠️

### ❌ **ACTIVE BUGS:**
1. **Multiple Windows/Modals Appearing** - Infinite loop in React components causing UI duplication
2. **"Failed to load initial data" Error** - Data loading mechanism failing after login
3. **"Error creating user" Message** - User creation functionality broken
4. **Infinite API Calls** - Backend being overwhelmed by repeated GET requests every few milliseconds

### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Primary Issue**: Infinite loop in useEffect hooks causing continuous re-renders
- **Secondary Issue**: AdminDashboard.jsx has syntax error (duplicate state declaration)
- **Tertiary Issue**: Browser cache holding onto old buggy code

### 🛠️ **Fixes Applied:**
1. ✅ Rewrote AppContext.jsx to remove useCallback infinite loops
2. ✅ Fixed duplicate state declaration in AdminDashboard.jsx  
3. ✅ Simplified data loading mechanism
4. ✅ Added loading state checks to prevent multiple simultaneous API calls
5. ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### 🔄 **Current Status:**
- **Backend**: ✅ All APIs working correctly (returning 200 OK)
- **Frontend**: ❌ Still experiencing infinite loop due to cached components
- **Authentication**: ✅ Login successful with admin/admin_007
- **Data Display**: ❌ "Failed to load initial data" error persists
- **User Creation**: ❌ "Error creating user" still occurring
