# Test Results & User Problem Statement

## Original User Problem Statement
**Issue reported**: "i cant seem to run in desktop"

### Specific Problems Identified:
1. Cannot access localhost:8000 (incorrect port - should be 8001 for backend)
2. MongoDB not installed locally 
3. Login credentials confusion (tried admin/admin_123, admin-007, admin_007 instead of admin/admin_007)
4. Missing local environment setup

## Current System Status - CRITICAL BUGS IDENTIFIED ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚ùå **ACTIVE BUGS:**
1. **Multiple Windows/Modals Appearing** - Infinite loop in React components causing UI duplication
2. **"Failed to load initial data" Error** - Data loading mechanism failing after login
3. **"Error creating user" Message** - User creation functionality broken
4. **Infinite API Calls** - Backend being overwhelmed by repeated GET requests every few milliseconds

### üîç **Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Primary Issue**: Infinite loop in useEffect hooks causing continuous re-renders
- **Secondary Issue**: AdminDashboard.jsx has syntax error (duplicate state declaration)
- **Tertiary Issue**: Browser cache holding onto old buggy code

### üõ†Ô∏è **Fixes Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Rewrote AppContext.jsx to remove useCallback infinite loops
2. ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate state declaration in AdminDashboard.jsx  
3. ‚úÖ Simplified data loading mechanism
4. ‚úÖ Added loading state checks to prevent multiple simultaneous API calls
5. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### üîÑ **Current Status:**
- **Backend**: ‚úÖ All APIs working correctly (returning 200 OK)
- **Frontend**: ‚ùå Still experiencing infinite loop due to cached components
- **Authentication**: ‚úÖ Login successful with admin/admin_007
- **Data Display**: ‚ùå "Failed to load initial data" error persists
- **User Creation**: ‚ùå "Error creating user" still occurring
