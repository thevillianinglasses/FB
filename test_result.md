# Test Results & User Problem Statement

## Original User Problem Statement
**Issue reported**: "i cant seem to run in desktop"

### Specific Problems Identified:
1. Cannot access localhost:8000 (incorrect port - should be 8001 for backend)
2. MongoDB not installed locally 
3. Login credentials confusion (tried admin/admin_123, admin-007, admin_007 instead of admin/admin_007)
4. Missing local environment setup
