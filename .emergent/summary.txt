The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a React-only Reception module into a full-stack EHR system using FastAPI for the backend and MongoDB as the database. The initial phase focused on setting up the core architecture, migrating existing reception features, and implementing JWT-based role-based authentication. A significant portion of the work involved troubleshooting environment and styling issues, specifically related to Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, and persistent port conflicts, which were systematically resolved. The AI then initiated the expansion to other modules (Laboratory, Pharmacy, Nursing, Doctors, Admin) by creating necessary backend APIs and frontend dashboard components, setting up the foundation for a comprehensive EHR. The latest work focused on creating a detailed  and  for desktop deployment, but the user reported an issue with running the application on their desktop, which is the current pending task.

<product_requirements>
The user is building a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, named Unicare Polyclinic, and requested to club it into an existing application (). The primary goal is to enhance user-friendliness while retaining existing logic and functions. Initially, only a Reception module was present. The user explicitly requested to expand the EHR to include multiple core modules: Reception, Laboratory, Pharmacy, Nursing, Doctors, and Admin.

Detailed features for each module include:
-   **Reception**: Patient registration (with duplicate detection, family linking), appointment booking, queue/token management, front-desk payments, communication (SMS/WhatsApp), document uploads, insurance handling, and display board integration.
-   **Laboratory**: Test catalog, order management (doctor/reception), sample tracking, results entry/validation, branded PDF reports, QC/logs, lab billing, and inventory.
-   **Pharmacy**: ePrescription intake, inventory, purchasing, pricing, dispensing/billing, pickup/delivery, and refill reminders.
-   **Nursing**: Triage/vitals, nursing notes, procedures, Medication Administration Record (MAR), and immunization logs.
-   **Doctors**: EMR (SOAP notes, problem list, history), diagnosis (ICD-10), orders (lab, imaging), ePrescription, certificates, attachments, decision support, follow-ups, and digital sign.
-   **Admin (Web/Admin app)**: Master data management (doctors, services, lab catalog, pharmacy items), scheduling, pricing/offers, user/role management, permissions/audit, billing rules, integrations (WhatsApp/SMS, payment gateway), clinic settings, reports/analytics, and backup/export.
-   **Finance**: Detailed cost analysis, P&L (revenue, COGS, OPEX, depreciation, net profit), and transaction tracking.

The user specifically requested the login credentials to be  and to start with a fresh database, not preserving old patient data. The current status is that the Reception module is fully functional, with a robust backend and user interface, and the foundational structure for all other modules and role-based access has been laid out.

-   **Supervisor**: Process control system for managing backend and frontend services.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication and authorization.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented for different user types (Admin, Reception, Laboratory, Pharmacy, Nursing, Doctor).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database.



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Updated to include FastAPI, Pymongo, PyJWT, Passlib, python-multipart for backend functionalities.
-   : Configured with  for local MongoDB access.
-   : **Created** to define Pydantic models for users, patients, and other entities, crucial for data structure and validation. It defines , ,  models, using  for IDs.
-   : **Created** to handle user authentication, password hashing (), and JWT token generation/validation. It includes functions for , , , etc.
-   : **Rewritten and extended** to become the core FastAPI application. It now includes:
    -   CORS middleware setup.
    -   User authentication endpoints (, ).
    -   User management (create, get users, delete users) for admin.
    -   Patient management API ( for create, get all).
    -   Placeholder API routes for Laboratory, Pharmacy, Nursing, and Doctors modules, demonstrating the role-based access control.
    -   Database connection setup to MongoDB.
-   : Modified to specify React, Vite, Tailwind CSS dependencies. It also defines the  script to run the Vite development server.
-   : **Created/Modified** to include  (changed from  due to Vite specifics). This is critical for the frontend to connect to the backend.
-   : **Created/Modified** to centralize API calls to the backend, including  and  functions, ensuring proper token handling.
-   : **Modified** to manage global application state, including user authentication status, user role, and loading initial data after login.
-   : **Rewritten** to implement routing for different pages (Login, main dashboard) and to dynamically render specific dashboard components based on the logged-in user's role. It handles authentication flow and initial data loading.
-   : **Modified** to use the new  for authentication and integrate with  for state management.
-   : **Modified** to interact with the backend  endpoint for patient registration.
-   : **Modified** to fetch and display patient data from the backend.
-   : **Modified** to define custom color palette (, , ) and include content paths for Tailwind JIT compilation. It was also temporarily downgraded to v3 and then re-configured for v4 compatibility troubleshooting.
-   : **Modified** to correctly integrate Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer, resolving a critical CSS build issue by removing an incorrect  plugin reference.
-   : **New files created** for , , , , , and  to act as entry points for each module's UI, rendered conditionally by .
-   : **Modified** to ensure  and  services are managed correctly and start with the appropriate commands and ports (backend on 8001, frontend attempting 3000 but often running on 3001 due to conflicts).
-   : **Updated** with basic project description, tech stack, and login credentials.
-   : **Created** to provide detailed step-by-step instructions for desktop installation and usage.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Desktop Installation Issue**: The user explicitly stated, i cant seem to run in desktop, indicating an unresolved issue with running the application outside the provided environment. This is the immediate priority.
-   **Full Module Implementation**: While dashboard components and basic API endpoints for all modules (Laboratory, Pharmacy, Nursing, Doctors, Admin beyond user management) have been created, the comprehensive features detailed in the product requirements for each module are yet to be implemented.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work before this summary request was to address the user's explicit report: i cant seem to run in desktop. The AI engineer was in the process of troubleshooting this issue.

The product's current state is a fully functional Unicare EHR system, specifically the Reception module, with a robust full-stack architecture.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI running on . It includes:
    -   JWT-based authentication with  as default credentials.
    -   Role-based access control (Admin, Reception, Laboratory, Pharmacy, Nursing, Doctor).
    -   User management APIs (create, list, delete users).
    -   Patient management APIs (create, list, edit, delete patients).
    -   Basic API endpoints and data models (using UUIDs, not MongoDB ObjectIDs) are in place for all six core modules.
-   **Frontend**: React application (initially on port 3000, but often runs on 3001 due to persistent port conflicts) with:
    -   A professional, branded UI using Tailwind CSS with custom colors (cornflower blue, charcoal grey, coral red).
    -   A working login page that redirects users to role-specific dashboards.
    -   The Reception module's New OPD and All Patients functionalities are fully integrated with the backend, supporting patient registration, auto-generated OPD and token numbers, and displaying patient data.
    -   Placeholder dashboard components (, , etc.) exist for all six roles, providing the foundational UI structure.
-   **Documentation**: A comprehensive  and a newly created  are present, aiming to guide desktop installation.

Key nuances include:
-   Persistent port 3000 conflicts, often leading the frontend to run on 3001.
-   Extensive troubleshooting of frontend build issues (Vite, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, environment variables) which have since been resolved.
-   Successful implementation and verification of role-based login and user creation through backend and frontend interactions.
